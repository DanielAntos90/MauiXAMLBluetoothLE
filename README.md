# MauiXAMLBluetoothLE

.Net MAUI app using Plugin.BLE for Polar H10 Heart Rate Sensor. Bluetooth LE working solution on Android. I must ask James Montemagno for help to get permissions right on iOS and Windows.

Permissions explained by James Montemagno https://youtu.be/9GljgwfpiiE. Thank you.

To read code and understand it is simple.

This app might bring closer Bluetooth LE to .Net MAUI. I hope so.
